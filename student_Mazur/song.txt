I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
And now i'm away
And now i'm here
I'm away
No more

You wake up
Watch the world go 'round
You shiver
Feeling upside down
Your heart is beating fast
Pumping blood to your head
Another day to fight
You have a prayer on your lips
Under the desert sun
And a loaded gun

You remember every word
That your father said
Stay out of trouble son
And be true to yourself
You'll be working like a dog
Raise a family
And life will be alright
But now it's written in the stars
If you'll make it out alive
Out alive
